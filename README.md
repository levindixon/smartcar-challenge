# Smartcar Challenge

Welcome to the Smartcar challenge solution! Following the [test criteria](https://github.com/levindixon/smartcar-challenge/blob/master/criteria.html) an app was written to take in an API schema and dynamically create docs.

## Getting started

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

## About the app

The appâ€™s build processes utilize [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and [babel](https://babeljs.io/). This allows for the use of new ES6 features and syntax.

The app was built using react, and follows [flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html) application architecture with unidirectional data flow.

Styling was done using [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

## Building the app:

1. [Bootstraping the app and constructing the build processes.](https://github.com/levindixon/smartcar-challenge/pull/1)
2. [Mocking up the app](https://github.com/levindixon/smartcar-challenge/pull/2)
3. [Fetching the API schema and making it available to the rest of the app](https://github.com/levindixon/smartcar-challenge/pull/3)
4. [Building the docs from the schema](https://github.com/levindixon/smartcar-challenge/pull/4)
5. [Stubbing an example response object section](https://github.com/levindixon/smartcar-challenge/pull/5)
6. [Adding the ability to input vehicle id and providing a user with an API key, injecting that into examples](https://github.com/levindixon/smartcar-challenge/pull/6)
7. [Adding the ability to generate a new API key](https://github.com/levindixon/smartcar-challenge/pull/7)
8. [Designing the app](https://github.com/levindixon/smartcar-challenge/pull/8)
9. [Styling the app](https://github.com/levindixon/smartcar-challenge/pull/9)

## Things to improve on:

- Unit tests! Implement chai/mocha
